SEVERE FATIGUE IN MY BODY AND TIREDNESS AND MUSCLE PAINS IN MY HIPS THAT CONTINUE TO THIS DAY AFTER BEING OFF THE DRUG FOR ALMOST A YEAR. DO NOT TAKE THIS DRUG!!!!!!!. I was put on this drug by my doctor for my somewhat high cholesterol. The next day, after starting this drug, I suddenly felt like I had aged to eighty years old overnight but did not connect it to starting Lipitor. Up until the start of this drug I felt that I was as young as I was in my twenties and wondered if this is how you might start feeling the affects of age, by waking up one morning and feeling all that age caught up with you and now you were older than your years. I took the drug for two terrible months and then had a blood test and my cholesterol had dropped. My doctor mailed me the results of my blood test but did not send me a new prescription like he had the last time so I did not know that he wanted me to get it refilled. So I went off of Lipitor and within two months I was feeling normal again and even took a job with the post office where I walked five miles a day with no problem. I did not associate my getting better with my coming off Lipitor, unfortunately. Then I had an appointment with my doctor and he said I should have refilled that prescription by calling his office. So I did and the next day, after taking only one pill, I was eighty years old again. This time I did associate it with the start of Lipitor and then read the warnings the drug store gives you with meds and found that my symptoms were the same as what they warned against.
